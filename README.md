# Headsmasher

## 🎮 Description
**Headsmasher** is a simple 3D head-punching simulation featuring visual, sound, and physical feedback (knockback).
The main focus is on immersion and the “juicy” feel of the hits — short reaction animations, punch sound effects. 

---
## 📝 Technical Implementation
Unity 2022.3 LTS (use version 2022.3.62f2).
Animations: Mixamo hit reaction animations, imported and tuned for the Animator.
Damage System: On collision, HP decreases; when it reaches 0, a death logic is triggered and the object is deactivated.
Audio: Short punch SFX are played on each hit for impact feedback.
